<!-- In HTML, most elements are defined as block level or inline elements.
Block level elements start from a new line.
For example: <h1>, <form>, <li>, <ol>, <ul>, <p>, <pre>, <table>, <div>, etc.

Inline elements are normally displayed without line breaks.
For example: <b>, <a>, <strong>, <img>, <input>, <em>, <span>, etc.

The <div> element is a block-level element that is often used as a container for other HTML elements.
When used together with some CSS styling, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content: -->

<html>
    <body>
        <h1>Headline</h1>
        <div style="background-color:green; color:white; padding:20px;">
            <p>Some paragraph text goes here.</p>
            <p>Another paragraph goes here.</p>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>

<!-- Similarly, the <span> element is an inline element that is often used as a container for some text.
When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text -->

  <html>
    <body>
        <h2>Some 
            <span style="color:red">Important</span>
             Message</h2>
    </body>
</html>

<!--Summary
The <div> element defines a block-level section in a document.
The <span> element defines an inline section in a document.-->

<!-- Other elements can be used either as block level elements or inline elements. This includes the following elements:

APPLET - embedded Java applet
IFRAME - Inline frame
INS - inserted text
MAP - image map
OBJECT - embedded object
SCRIPT - script within an HTML document

You can insert inline elements inside block elements.
For example, you can have multiple <span> elements inside a <div> element. 

***Inline elements cannot contain any block level elements.***-->
