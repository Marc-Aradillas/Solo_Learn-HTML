The <article> Element


Article is a self-contained, independent piece of content that can be used and distributed separately from the rest of the page or site. 
This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent piece of content.

The <article> element replaces the <div> element that was widely used in HTML4, along with an id or class.

example:
<article>
    <h1>The article title</h1> 
    <p>Contents of the article element </p>
</article>
  
When an <article> element is nested, the inner element represents an article related to the outer element.
For example, blog post comments can be <article> elements nested in the <article> representing the blog post.
