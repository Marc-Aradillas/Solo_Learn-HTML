HTML5 Forms


HTML5 brings many features and improvements to web form creation. There are new attributes and input types that were introduced to help create better experiences for web users.

Form creation is done in HTML5 the same way as it was in HTML4:

<form>
    <label>Your name:</label>
    <input id="user" name="username" type="text" />
</form>

Use the novalidate attribute to avoid form validation on submissions.



New Attributes


HTML5 has introduced a new attribute called placeholder. On <input> and <textarea> elements, this attribute provides a hint to the user of what information can be entered into the field.

<form>
    <label for="email">Your e-mail address: </label>
    <input type="text" name="email" placeholder="email@example.com" />
</form>
