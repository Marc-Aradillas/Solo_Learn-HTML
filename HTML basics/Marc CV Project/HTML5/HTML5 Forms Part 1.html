HTML5 Forms


HTML5 brings many features and improvements to web form creation. There are new attributes and input types that were introduced to help create better experiences for web users.

Form creation is done in HTML5 the same way as it was in HTML4:

<form>
    <label>Your name:</label>
    <input id="user" name="username" type="text" />
</form>

Use the novalidate attribute to avoid form validation on submissions.



New Attributes


HTML5 has introduced a new attribute called placeholder. On <input> and <textarea> elements, this attribute provides a hint to the user of what information can be entered into the field.

<form>
    <label for="email">Your e-mail address: </label>
    <input type="text" name="email" placeholder="email@example.com" />
</form>


    
The autofocus attribute makes the desired input focus when the form loads:

<form>
    <label for="email">Your e-mail address: </label>
    <input type="text" name="email" autofocus />
</form>
    
The required attribute tells the browser that the input is required.
    
    

    
    
    
The "required" attribute is used to make the input elements required.

The form will not be submitted without filling in the required fields.

Result:
    
<form autocomplete="off">
    <label for="e-mail">Your e-mail address: </label>
    <input name="Email" type="text" required />
    <input type="submit" value="Submit"/>
</form>
    
    *** The autocomplete attribute specifies whether a form or input field should have autocomplete turned on or off.
When autocomplete is on, the browser automatically complete values based on values that the user has entered before. ***
    

    
HTML5 added several new input types:
- color
- date
- datetime
- datetime-local
- email
- month
