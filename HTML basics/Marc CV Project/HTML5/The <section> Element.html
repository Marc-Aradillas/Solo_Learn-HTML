The <section> Element


<section> is a logical container of the page or article.
Sections can be used to divide up content within an article.
For example, a homepage could have a section for introducing the company, another for news items, and still another for contact information.

Each <section> should be identified, typically by including a heading (h1-h6 element) as a child of the <section> element.
  
<article>
    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <section>
        <h1>Heading</h1>
        <p>content or image</p>
    </section>
</article>
  
If it makes sense to separately syndicate the content of a <section> element, use an <article> element instead.
