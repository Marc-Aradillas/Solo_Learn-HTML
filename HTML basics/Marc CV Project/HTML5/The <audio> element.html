Before HTML5, there was no standard for playing audio files on a web page.
The HTML5 <audio> element specifies a standard for embedding audio in a web page.

There are two different ways to specify the audio source file's URL. 

The first uses the source attribute:

<audio src="http://www.sololearn.com/uploads/audio.mp3" controls>
    Audio element not supported by your browser
</audio>

The second way uses the <source> element inside the <audio> element:

<audio controls>
    <source src="http://www.sololearn.com/uploads/audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    <source src="http://www.sololearn.com/uploads/audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
</audio>

Multiple <source> elements can be linked to different audio files. The browser will use the first recognized format.
    

    
Audio on the Web
    
The <audio> element creates an audio player inside the browser.
    
<audio controls>
    <source src="http://www.sololearn.com/uploads/audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    <source src="http://www.sololearn.com/uploads/audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
    Audio element not supported by your browser. 
</audio>
    
    The text between the <audio> and </audio> tags will display in browsers that do not support the <audio> element.
