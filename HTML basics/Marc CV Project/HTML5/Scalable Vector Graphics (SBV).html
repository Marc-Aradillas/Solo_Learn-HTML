Drawing Shapes

SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, and is used to draw shapes with HTML-style markup.
It offers several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and graphic images.


SVG is not pixel-based, so it can be magnified infinitely with no loss of quality.



Inserting SVG Images


An SVG image can be added to HTML code with just a basic image tag that includes a source attribute pointing to the image:

<img src="image.svg" alt="" height="300" />

SVG defines vector-based graphics in XML format.





Drawing a Circle


To draw shapes with SVG, you first need to create an SVG element tag with two attributes: width and height.

svg width="1000" height="1000"></svg>

To create a circle, add a <circle> tag:
  
  <svg width="2000" height="2000">
   <circle cx="80" cy="80" r="50" fill="green" />
</svg>
  
- cx pushes the center of the circle further to the right of the screen
- cy pushes the center of the circle further down from the top of the screen
- r defines the radius
- fill determines the color of our circle
- stroke adds an outline to the circle

Result: green circle
  
Every element and every attribute in SVG files can be animated.

  
  

Other Shape Elements


<rect> defines a rectangle:
  
The following code will draw a green-filled rectangle.

<svg width="2000" height="2000">
   <rect width="300" height="100" 
     x="20" y="20" fill="green" />
</svg>
  
  
<line> defines a line segment:
  
<svg width="400" height="410">
  <line x1="10" y1="10" x2="200" y2="100" 
      style="stroke:#000000; stroke-linecap:round; 
      stroke-width:20"  />
</svg>
