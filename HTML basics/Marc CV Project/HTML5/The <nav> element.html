The <nav> Element


This tag represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to certain sections within the page. This would be a section with navigation links.

Here is an example of a major block of navigation links:

<nav>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Services</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">About us</a></li>
    </ul>
</nav>
  

Not all of the links in a document should be inside a <nav> element. 
The <nav> element is intended only for major blocks of navigation links. 
Typically, the <footer> element often has a list of links that don't need to be in a <nav> element.
