The <canvas> Element

The HTML canvas is used to draw graphics that include everything from simple lines to complex graphic objects.

The <canvas> element is defined by:
  
<canvas id="canvas1" width="200" height="100">
</canvas>

The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics. You must use a script to actually draw the graphics (usually JavaScript).
The <canvas> element must have an id attribute so it can be referred to by JavaScript:

<html>
   <head></head>
   <body>
     <canvas id="canvas1" 
   width="400" height="300"></canvas> 

   <script>
      var can = document.getElementById("canvas1"); 
      var ctx = can.getContext("2d");
   </script>

   </body>
</html>

  
getContext() returns a drawing context on the canvas.
  
Basic knowledge of JavaScript is required to understand and use the Canvas.
  



Canvas Coordinates


The HTML canvas is a two-dimensional grid.
The upper-left corner of the canvas has the coordinates (0,0).

X coordinate increases to the right.
Y coordinate increases toward the bottom of the canvas.
  
The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics.
  
  
  
Drawing Shapes


The fillRect(x, y, w, h) method draws a "filled" rectangle, in which w indicates width and h indicates height. The default fill color is black.

A black 100*100 pixel rectangle is drawn on the canvas at the position (20, 20):
  
<html>
    <head></head>
    <body>
        <canvas id="canvas1" width="400" height="300">
        </canvas> 
    <script>
        var c=document.getElementById("canvas1");
        var ctx=c.getContext("2d");
        ctx.fillRect(20,20,100,100);
    </script>
    </body>
</html>
  
The fillStyle property is used to set a color, gradient, or pattern to fill the drawing.
Using this property allows you to draw a green-filled rectangle.
  
<html>
    <head></head>
    <body>
        <canvas id="canvas1" width="400" height="300">
        </canvas> 
        <script>
            var canvas=document.getElementById("canvas1");
            var ctx=canvas.getContext("2d");
            ctx.fillStyle ="rgba(0, 200, 0, 1)";
            ctx.fillRect (36, 10, 22, 22);
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
  

The canvas supports various other methods for drawing:

Draw a Line
  
moveTo(x,y): Defines the starting point of the line.
lineTo(x,y): Defines the ending point of the line.

Draw a Circle
  
beginPath(): Starts the drawing.
arc(x,y,r,start,stop): Sets the parameters of the circle.
stroke(): Ends the drawing.

Gradients
  
createLinearGradient(x,y,x1,y1): Creates a linear gradient.
createRadialGradient(x,y,r,x1,y1,r1): Creates a radial/circular gradient.

Drawing Text on the Canvas
  
Font: Defines the font properties for the text.
fillText(text,x,y): Draws "filled" text on the canvas.
strokeText(text,x,y): Draws text on the canvas (no fill).
  
  There are many other methods aimed at helping to draw shapes and images on the canvas.
